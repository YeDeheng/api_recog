I haven't checked any of the details and you should therefore not rely on it to be correct .
You can access members and slices of the array as you would with normal numpy arrays .
Running 1000 simulations at the same time might be a bit expensive though .
I need to look at other formats that allow create .
finding element of numpy array that satisfies condition
All the results ( percentage ) are the comparison between the described condition and the reference which here is the packaged ATLAS library .
how do you use ` slicing ` to extract something from ` x ` ?
Mapping a numpy array pairwise
If that is all you want to do , it should just work otherwise look at #URL since subclassing an array is not that simple .
If you want to access an individual element using 2D notation , you can create a view and work with that .
Regarding 3 , I don't think this would be necessary since the above trick can also be applied to an array allocated by ` shmarray ` .
And here a list with the names of all distribution functions available in Scipy 0.12.0 ( VI ): #CODE
I get this error whenever i try to use any functions of matplotlib such as graph etc ...
Numpy is designed for repeated application of the exact same operation in parallel across an array .
Each B i is a ` k ` -by- ` n ` matrix .
I created a copy of the initial array in the hope that it would sort it out but it still doesn't work !
So far , all the solutions I found required converting to IPLImage .
However , I haven't tested this very systematically , and it's likely that for smaller matrices the additional overhead would outweigh the performance benefit from a higher thread count .
but why dimA+dimB to begin with , that just leaves you 0s at the end .
If you select a list of actual fitness entries , ` indices ` , the corresponding points are given by ` A [ ' point '] [ indices ]` , which is a simple ` ( n , 3 )` array .
It's also possible to generate an array of indices without using ` enumerate ` .
If you want to keep the array allocated , and with the same size , you don't need to clear the elements .
It'll print out all methods and properties of the object .
Search numpy array inside numpy array
Assigning a view to a structured array also copies the data , soyour suggestion doesnt work .
If you know there are not many different values ( relative to the size of the input " itemArray ") , something like this could be efficient : #CODE
When I import numpy in a script , I don't have all the functions of numpy available , only few of them ( not a lot , and not array ) ?
It allows to have your custom system inside the home directory accessible via proot and , therefore , you can install any packages without root privileges .
Hey , is there an optimal size for a block ?
Numpy array , how to select indices satisfying multiple conditions ?
I'm still learning git and this whole open source thing .
A further problem is that a list index can't contain duplicates - I couldn't simultaneously read pixels ` [ 1 , 2 ]` and ` [ 1 , 3 ]` , since my list of pixel x-coordinates would contain ` [ 1 , 1 ]` .
Your interpretation is , of course , quite correct : ` count ` refers to the number of elements in the ` float* ` " array " .
This all works .
Of course it may _not_ be acceptable , but it seemed like it was at least trying .
I think what should happen is for R to be overwritten with an upper triangular matrix .
@USER Is there a way to get it to return all possible solutions ?
Thank you all for some great insight !
as numpy array of 0 and 1 values .
By construction of the problem , there can not be any non-unique values lying within one another .
Both functions are kind of equal , but are different .
For a sparse csr matrix ( X ) and a list of indices to drop ( index_to_drop ): #CODE
This will be relatively slow , and requires you to have twice the free memory space required to store the array .
I need numpy for this because I don't want to loop through the array n-times for n groups , since my array sizes can be arbitrarily large .
I wonder what the speed delta between native Numpy arrays and an ` mpfr ` array , seeing as ` mpfr ` is a relatively low-level C wrapper class .
In this particular case , each 1D column ( ` column = myarray [ i , j , :] `) of the 3D array can be treated independently .
Any ideas ?
Then take element 3 and 1 from second row , etc .
print len ( index )
I don't know how to label rows and columns in numpy , so I just made a dict mapping the row label to the row index and another doing the same for the columns .
It's the same as a normal solve except I know some of the solution to begin with .
yeah , this is the best answer anywhere where edge cases are important .
With this , I solve the problem ( may help you ): #CODE
Teach a man to fish and all that .
Looks like this would be a good place to use a context manager , so you can say " with fullprint " .
What do you mean by ' random sort ' ?
However , it indeed does not allow you to exponentiate any matrix directly : #CODE
The first one would probably be slow for large data , and the second one does not seem to offer any other interpolation method except splines .
EDIT : For the record , here is example code that demonstrates the issue : #CODE
In terms of functionality , it's not a metaclass at all , it's a function which takes a class ( along with some others stuff ) and returns a new class .
or from source #CODE
Didn't do any timings here , but it's possible this version has reasonable performance .
I'll just test whether or not there's a significan space gain on my data with protocol 2 .
Just wanted to add that the moving average function has been extracted into the [ Bottleneck ] ( #URL ) library if pandas seems too heavyweight as a dependency .
` numpy ` can use ` malloc ` / ` realloc ` for creating an array of objects of ` sizeof ( int )` .
If you read through the documentation of those engines you will often find statements saying that they are optimized for speed ( 30fps - 60fps ) .
I know I have to look at each row , but I don't want to do it with loops .
I'm hoping this can at least save someone a few hours of hopeless research for this topic .
What does " doesn't work " mean ?
You might look at your code that generates the ` y ` values , and see if that would benefit from the use of additional numpy or scipy functions .
For example , give the list [ ( .3 , ' a ') , ( .4 , ' b ') , ( .3 , ' c ')] I'd like to sample ' b ' 40% of the time .
The square bracket idea you mentioned works for my current problem .
However , when I try to use a weighted average #CODE
If I scale that to a 2000 X 2000 np array , here is what I get : #CODE
Unfortunately , I'm not aware of a numpy implementation , but I did find this : #URL
We can do this quite neatly using numpy , without having to worry about the channels at all !
It's not exactly the most efficient way , but it will work , and not require keeping a copy of the file in memory ( or two ) .
I'm trying to find the fastest way to find the first non-zero value for each row of a two dimensional sorted array .
Convert the numpy array into a list first .
@USER do you mean that grid dictonary holds the results in memory or something else ?
@USER : This solution is indeed designed to give the set of all the numbers found in the array .
This way at most one line is in memory at any one time .
It's low efficiency , I want to know are there any builtin functions that can do this in NumPy .
The raw hardware data is 32-bit signed integer , which becomes float when I convert it to normal physics units ( m / s )
Calculate subset of matrix multiplication
EDIT : as to what DSM pointed out , OP is infact using a numpy array .
As for the second question , ` delete ` has been suggested before : #CODE
The remaining rows of the matrices are all linear combinations ( in fact exact copies for almost all submatrices ) of these rows .
I'm printing the contents of an array with a header .
Edit : If you need to save memory try radix sort , which is much faster on integers than quicksort ( which I believe is what numpy uses ) .
The data was in following order ( with sample data ) #CODE
definitely a good solution , nevertheless I'd like to solve this without a range , but the nearest neighbour .
For my recent project that works on the order of 20000x20000 matrix entries , I will quickly and disastrously use up all of my workstation's 8GB of RAM and more .
Well , this might give a small speed-up just because it uses less memory .
Try using ` all ` ( edited to return ` int `) : #CODE
: I don't care if the statement modifies array or not .
Rather than doing nans I put in -1 and then filtered on match = b > = 0 .
Removing duplicate columns and rows from a NumPy 2D array
arrays to extract arrays of the same
as i have to test if it works or not so minimum i have to try with 10-15 different types of images . its not specific images it can be any image of people .
So having a python loop , and having to sum all the results together , is taking 390 ms more than 200 times what it takes to solve each of the 200 systems that have to be solved .
You could then sample pixels at the locations of the new points .
I could use an idea about either how to fix the compilation errors or another way to convert my python objects .
I tried every possible combination resulting with a 0 bytes file if the extension was mpg , and 5.5kb if it was avi .
Fortran 90 DOES support arbitrary lower bounds on arrays , and borrowing from that paradigm sounds quite plausible .
I want to perform an operation on a that increments all the values inside it that are less than 0 and leaves the rest alone . for example , if I had : #CODE
I like how this one uses straight python slicing and doesn't require numpy
I select the first value using ` ys [ 0 ]` .
While waiting for the next buffer to fill , I'd like to process the most recent buffer with numpy and save the result .
( They all do the same thing , in this case . )
As of PIL 1.1.6 , the " proper " way to convert between images and numpy arrays is simply #CODE
So first you need to construct an array that represents the rows you wish to select .
Any ideas how to improve this ?
If this is the case , you can easily plot a known asymmetric shape and the plot will tell you everything .
Apart from the compression part , this shouldn't be any slower than normal .
Acquiring the Minimum array out of Multiple Arrays by order in Python

In other words ... yes you can trust it to be faster ... but don't think python is that slow that you cannot do a for loop over 3 items without waiting for ages ...
And all that while you're getting lunch .
If you do want to raise some sort of exception for invalid data ( not type checking ) , either let an existing exception propagate , or wrap it in your own exception type .
casting are used in Numexpr , in contrast with NumPy , where array types
I check mathexchange and while making the tags for the post , it didn't have any the ones that would seem relevant like scipy and numpy or even sparse .
Any help would be appreciated .
Say not that efficiency is a secondary priority ; say instead that I want to perform bivariate optimization : pythonicity + efficiency ( hence the post title ) .
Does numpy have any constructs to make this easier ?
If you view ` P ` as a rank-2 tensor then only three options exist for the product of ` P ` with itself , 1 ) either all the indexes cancel leaving you with a rank-0 tensor ( a scalar ) , 2 ) 1 set of indexes cancels and you are left with a rank-2 tensor ( a matrix ) , or 3 ) none of them cancel and you're left with a rank-4 tensor .
At the moment I made a custom iterator class that builds a list of lists .
This basically sees whether two circles ( with coordinates that correspond to the indices n and m ) connect .
It would mean Gaussian quadrature using points along the line that are easily evaluated .
I see one potential problem - beta is defined as 1-dimensional , but its value is given as 2-dimensional ( dimensions of size 1 still count as dimensions )
Can you provide an algorithm for computing them based on block size ?
If ` X ` is your array , #CODE
You could cast the array to a list : #CODE
But if you for example self compiled from the development version an update may fix most of it .
In VTK I am able to use the following snippet to save the render window as an image .
In other words , the 4th row in A_sorted was the 1st row in the original array , A , etc .
Add a ` return ` statement at the end of the method .
However , with different input sizes , using fft's to do a convolution can be considerably faster ( Though I can't seem to come up with a good example , at the moment ... ) .
That is a shallow copy ...
@USER The solutions there all make use of the fact that only a 3x3 sliding window is needed , but I need something that works for all sizes of templates .
A masked array is useful here : #CODE
Second I would like it to be easily expandable , that I can add new functions easily .
If i have two variables - where they either are a 1d array of values length n , or are a single value , how do i loop through them so that I get n values returned .
I think masked arrays have been in numpy for a few years now .
I have an array defined in this way ( extracting the third column of a dataset ): #CODE
I wasn't aware of the option of using ` data [ list ]` to select multiple columns .
Beware that if the type of the output array is
Any ideas how I would do this calculation in a simpler way ?
Those take up about 15MB of space which , considering that I get about 1000 result files in a series , is unacceptable to save .
I'm trying to implement a logic where I'm trying to subtract each element of an array from every other element of the array and then find the minimum difference of the result .
My final matrix should have 5416 rows with 500 000 column each .
I am attempting to process data saved to CSV that may have missing values in an unknown number of columns ( up to around 30 ) .
Actually the surprise is still hidden in a way , because in your examples ` a [ indices ]` is the same as ` a [ indices [ 0 ] , indicies [ 1 ]]` but ` a [ indicies , :] ` is ` a [( indicies [ 0 ] , indicies [ 1 ]) , :] ` which is not a big surprise that it is different .
Slice numpy array wth list of wanted rows
Here is a slightly more complex version that always returns a view into the original array ( of course provided that you don't do any advanced indexing ; this should be guaranteed by your specification of valid indices ): #CODE
If the array is one-dimensional , this means it has no effect .
The problem with using ` view ` , however , is that a 32-bit integer becomes viewed as 4 8-b it integers , and we only care about the value in the last 8-b its .
So this won't solve OP's question ( unless his nD is 2 or 3 ) .
Note : this was meant as a comment , not an answer ... just needed more room to put in the example above .
If I wanted to change the data type of a numpy array permanently , is reassignment the best way ?
The shifted shm-allocated array is indeed accessible from other processes .
The second solution you propose is better from that point of view .
It checks for nans and empty input strings .
The ability to extract columns and rows by header name ( as in the above example )
With Python 2.6.5 or Python 2.7 , and Numpy 1.5.0 , I don't get any error .
Returns a boolean array the same length as ` ar1 ` that is True
If the objects in the array are not fixed size ( such as your MultiEvent ) the operations can become much slower .
@USER : True the code I gave would not be all the efficient

Is there a way to copy just the reference to b , so that when I change b , the change is reflected in ` a [ ' B '] [ i ]` ?
If the matrix is not symmetric be careful about the order in dot .
So I changed the " array " to matrix .
config paths , cflags .
gnibbler : That completely misses the point of the algorithm , this is a simple example , what I am doing is Gauss-Seidel iteration , which infers information about a location in a matrix by using data that has already been inferred in previous entries .

You can write that as a matrix : #CODE
In fact , if you use tuples as Justin suggested and iterate directly over the rows of the array ( ` for row in data : `) , it's actually faster than my method below .
Using the ` ctypedef ` keyword in Cython will make it add the C / C++ ` typedef ` statement with the given types in the compiled Cython-code .
Here is how I would compute a subset of the elements of C given a list of tuples of C index values .
In my specific problem ` A , B ` are slices out of a bigger 3-dimensional array ` Z ` ,
The solution to get all the data you need as you build the list , by using the accessor on each iteration .
Edit : Actually you could also sort both arrays into one ( and remember which one belongs to which class ) , then go from there by checking where two of the different class are next to each other .
How can I integrate it from a given value ` a ` to another value ` b ` so that the output is a corresponding array ?
I want to multiply a sparse matrix A , with a matrix B which has 0 , -1 , or 1 as elements .
If you turn a ` dict ` into an array , you'll get an object array .
` Holy CPU cycles batman !
Note : Xarray and Yarray are each single-column vectors with data at each index that links the two arrays as sets of x , y coordinates .
Yeah , my rule-of-thumb is ** numpy ** for anything that can handle small amounts of latency but has the potential to be very large , ** lists ** for smaller data sets where latency critical , and of course ** real benchmarking ** FTW :)
You need to know what kind of information is stored in each field for the ` struct ` module to make sense of each field .
Once you have this array , you can get your sums for each vertex as #CODE
Where are ` plot ` and ` show ` coming from ?
But it might be easier ( and more understandable when you look at the code in the future ) to just drop into Cython to get this done .
I can't comment on the Perl code , I simply don't know it at all .
I updated the answer with a full example .
There you will find C code which provides the same functionality as ` fmincon ` .
so for instance , for an array the code looked like #CODE
I've been trying to find a solution for hours .
Note that as implemented here , the first method gives incorrect results according to my test .
This is my test code : #CODE
This will short-circuit if you just want to determine if any match exists .
It also helps to know that a resource like Wolfram Alpha is available to you at all times .
What I meant was if we had three arrays ` X =[ 0 1 2 ] , Y =[ 0 1 1 ] , and Z =[ 0 2 2 ]` there would be six values in the range of greater than or equal 1 and and less than or equal to 2 .
You should really split this into two separate questions since each part is distinct .
This doesn't answer your problem exactly , but I think especially with the sum issue that you should see significant speedups with these changes .
Basically you're iterating through each item in ` Xa ` and omitting the ones that don't fall with the range .
This code has been written following the tips ( and copy / pasting ): #URL

As @USER -Anderson asked , why not avoid making an array ?
to create such an array .
In short , I find class C to provide an implementation that is over 60x faster than the method in the original post .
I suggest allocating an array of the correct size up-front , then populating it with data in each iteration .
edited my solution to include what I would do . let me know if this work , as i cannot fully test because i dont have test data .
The problem is if i don't want 0:10 , but an arbitrary set of indices .
and it occurs at the line : ` del innerAry [ j ]`
Do you have any references to back up that ` NaN handling is much slower than " normal " float at the CPU level ` ?
What do you mean by the line ?
For example if we stick with a linear search we can at least start at the appropriate end ( search backwards to find last value matching a condition ) .
Yes , but you don't get a numpy array out , do you ?

I'm liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required type annotations in cython I think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran .
( There are also chances that Python stores the number on the heap and all you get is a pointer to it , approximately doubling the footprint , without even taking in account metadata but that's slippery grounds , I'm always wrong when I talk about Python internals , so let's not dig it too much . )

In another question , other users offered some help if I could supply the array I was having trouble with .
The other thing is changing the size of the ticklabels in the colorbar which I haven't figured out .
Unfortunately , these lines are fast already , but I will take any speedup to offset the IO issues I have using GDAL .
First you need to write a function that when given an array of values , with the middle one being the element currently examined , will return some computation of those values .
Thanks in advance for any help .
so what you want is some sort of recursive assignment -- but i don't believe there is any guarantee that this will settle down into a constant value . sure it does in your case , but not in general -- for example : ` a [: ] = 2*a [: ]` would loop forever .

Bah : " operates on two n-dimensional arrays " should be " operates on an n-dimensional array " above .
Instead , they expect the user to either pass an array of shape ` ( r , c )` exactly , or for the user to pass a 1-D array that broadcasts up to shape ` ( r , c )` .
Though , it isn't so straight forward because I don't necessarily know how many duplicates of each lon or lat there are which determines the shape of the array .

A variable in Python is just a label for an object ; giving the object a new label doesn't change the object itself at all .
But this is actually where the doc belongs .
So given the sorted version , you can reconstruct the original by " putting items back where they came from " : #CODE

Not really , you can construct the Counter from any iterable .
( I have the code ready , but as i'm new to stackoverflow , i don't know where to put it . Here , in this comment field ? Or rather making a new answer ?? )
For example , one simple method to generate at most rank ` k ` ( when ` m ` is ` k+1 `) is to get a random valid B 0 , keep rotating all rows of this matrix up to get B 1 to B m-2 , set first row of B m-1 to all 1 , and the remaining rows to all 0 .
Glad you saw around it !
@USER : basically I am converting some matlab code into python , I can not write actual code because that is confidential , ( 1+float ( 100 )) Here 100 is coming from two dimension string matrix , that why I have written float to convert string variable .
instead of call plot ( test [ " x "] [ 5:10 ]) , you can call the plot method of Series object : #CODE
The size of a slice with ` 0:5 ` is not 6 as you say : it's 5 .
This ensures proper display and syntax highlighting - right now someone who would usually fix your formatting is likely to not do it because he'd have to remove all the HTML linebreaks on his own .
I believe you've reduced the problem to a one of finding roots .
In order to make sure it is still multiprocessor safe , I believe you will have to use the ` acquire ` and ` release ` methods that exist on the ` Array ` object , ` a ` , and its built in lock to make sure its all safely accessed ( though I'm not an expert on the multiprocessor module ) .
So , given your matrix M , your problem asks to maximize the PB function #CODE
I would like to find all elements within a specific range .
I cannot seem to find how to do that .
Any thoughts ?
If you want the PRNGs to be independent , do not seed them with anything .
In the end I'll probably take n randomly selected samples .
This is a mystery to me , though I would guess that there must be more overhead associated with accessing an array element than with appending to a list .
If it's not reasonable , you can always decompose the matrix multiplication yourself .
If the vectors do not have equal dimension , or if you want to avoid numpy , then perhaps , #CODE
In particular , you can't index a 2D matrix with a single integer , because -- well -- it's two dimensional and you need to specify two integers , hence the need for the extra 0 index in the second example .
nearly all of which the author responded to and in some cases ,
I added the slow Python code to the description .
The easy way - pick a random number q [ 0 , 1 ] .
will be the number of bytes which the pattern of streams will repeat after .
Any idea how I can later make 1.6.2 in / usr / local / lib work with python-dbg ?
Because I'm still not quite grasping the method and there seems to be simpler ways to solve the problem , I'm just going to put this here : #CODE
how do I fix that ?
The usual shape is ( xx , ) .
what does ` [ 0 , 1:3 ]` mean ?
@USER he basically considers x as my array and defines a function that gives the range of each row .. works fine .
I was just curious to find a * best practice * in this instance I suppose .
I'm guessing there's an easy way to do this without iterating through the full array .
I don't know how efficient ` Image ` is at storing images , but a list of bytes uses four bytes of space for each element in the list , so you'll burn more than 8GB of ( virtual ) memory ... and a lot of patience .
They are all floats
I want to efficiently iterate through the two columns , a [: , 0 ] and a [: , 1 ] and remove any pairs that meet a certain condition , in this case if they are NaN .
I turned ` color_array ` into a two-dimensional array , since this seems more appropriate .
An important caveat is that the array must be * contiguous * in memory -- otherwise the view fails .
You might want to also make sure that you use a method of generating your random numbers that causes them to fall into the range of 16 bit ints .
I have a 100x200 2D array expressed as a numpy array consisting of black ( 0 ) and white ( 255 ) cells .
If you know the shape of the array ( to find discover the edges ) you can use simple math ... annoying , time consuming ( to write and process ) , but pretty straight forward .
And yet another way , possibly faster ( thanks for all the comments , guys ! ): #CODE
Now , you can construct another matrix , B , that has 1s at certain locations to pick the elements from the set E .
But overhead of all the object creation it's true , plus the time of Numpy array creation .
I was trying to calculate the curvature of a surface given by array of points ( x , y , z ) .
You also don't have any speed improvement , when you try to do a function return in C instead of doing that in python , also array access is neglectable compared to the cost of the function call .
I want to view the file outside the python environment also .
The following code demonstrates how to get the indices of some vertex ( number 17 , in this example ): #CODE
@USER : the idea is possibly that two calculation that both arrive at positive infinity could get there via ** wildly ** different calculations .
Given a wavelength ( or band number ) , I would like to extract the 2D image corresponding to that wavelength .
( d / dx ) ^n ( d / dy ) ^m f ( x , y )
The ` a [: , 0 ] <3 ` will create an array of ` bool ` with the same dimension as ` a ` , which says which elements go into the selection .
( Maybe I should add this to this answer . )
Count elements in a box
The problem may cook down to mean being subtracted over all numbers , but in the next step they are not used anymore ...
I wrote a function that works , but it is extremely slow .
The plot commands split the arrays in two halfs and swap them to get a nicer picture .
Any help would be appreciated !
` be replaced with if ` d ` should become ` array ([[ 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 3 ]])` ?
How big is the triangular matrix ?
Program is to add two signals using Matlab
This tax makes sense when you are doing CPU bound operations like matrix decompositions and whose processing time takes longer than the time it takes to copy the data .
Numpy object array of numerical arrays
After looking at these page and other I got it working using raw uncoded buffers using mencoder ( ffmpeg solution still wanted ) .
thanks seberg . but I can create an array of objects using numpy , then I can assign an arbitrary array to each element of array ( in python interpreter ) . what do you think of this ?
Check if values in a set are in a numpy array in python
Would you know of a way to ** average ** the duplicates instead of sum them ?
I think that I phrased the question badly ; what I meant is I want a list when I input a list and I want a numpy array when I input a numpy array .
I have a list of numbers and I need to split into to corresponding arrays of different sizes , but that make up all the combinations of the array splitting up .
Yes , it is true that before you ask any question on stackoverflow , you should perform a minimum of research which includes looking for existing answers on stackoverflow .
This is probably the thing that is most important for numpy to know ... although there may be other subtle differences ( if numpy is doing some dirty hacking to get at information stored in a common block for instance ) .
You might want to add this link to the response : #URL
A list takes up significantly more memory than a comparably sized numpy array ( factor of ~2 ) -- So why are you going back to using lists ?
From my understanding , when you use python standard operators , these are fairly similar to using the ones from " import operator .
This gives you 4000 samples of your function , sampled at 33.33 Hz , representing 120 seconds of data .
Before , what you were doing was having SWIG convert the C++ ` std :: vector ` objects into Python tuples , and then passing those tuples back down to ` numpy ` - where they were converted again .
Currently I am generating a list of 7 numbers with random values from [ 0-1 ) then multiplying by [ X1 .. X7 ]
Introducing the transposing of the matrix everything is working correctly .
So I did everything , but I feel the slicing method I used ( and the initialisation of ` b `) is not pythonic at all : #CODE
The python extension calls this function and places it into the module-level numpy array variable ` arr ` ( and I make it read-only for good measure ): #CODE
Depending on the rig you have at the moment , optimizing your SciPy
Examples would be the git commit id of the current version , and the input parameters used to generate the data so that later I can look at the data and know exactly how I created it .
There are other ways to do this ( you may want to avoid storing a reference to a specific numpy array in each ` point ` , for example ) , but I hope it's a useful example .
I downloaded a new version of ` pip ` and installed locally in my home directory but the system wide old one is still used when I type ` pip ` at the prompt .
I need to iterate over the matrix summing all elements in rows 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 only
If you compare point i to point i+1 and remove all for which the distance is less than your threshold , then you will miss the cumulative effect of many small steps in the same direction .
In my output array I only want to include rows for position values which appear in all 3 input arrays .
Perhaps you should change the title of this question to more accurately reflect your specific problem .
Perhaps there is a good choice for this special case .
it must be a record in syntax boycotting !
Addressing ranges in a Scipy sparse matrix
Still , I would like something much more computationally efficient , like relying on builtin numpy functions , but I cannot find relevant functions , can someone help me ?
You can run the test suite to see if the build works .
The bit where you index into the original CSR matrix is surely expensive .
I don't believe there's a way to do what you're asking ( it would require unaligned access , which is highly inefficient on some architectures ) .
This should give a large speedup compared with iterating over each row in the array ...
Not sure what addition you're talking about nor what random replacements you mean .
I have a counter for c , and if it hits 50 I want it to print out that You have been mauled by a bear , and then on the screen have a bear pop up , whether the bear image is just a file in the same folder , or if it links to a webpage that I have the bear image hosted at .
I have yet to find anything in the python documentation that states how a list of list is assembled , is it like : #CODE
I'm trying to use leastsq for this , but I'm unsure how to adjust the line to be below all points instead of the line of best fit .
I do not want to store the array objects , I want to store the lists of numbers in a record list .
I have tried two different methods but both of them are slow .
Where can I find information regarding the ` L ` option and other options ?
The essential problem was that when the array is 1d you call it array [ i ] when it is 2d you call it array [ i ] [ j ] , without two separate cases I don't know how to handle this .
You can iterate through your input file ( in chunks if possible ) and convert the incoming data and insert them as rows into a memory-mapped numpy array .
This all works great when I run the Python ( command line ) tool that comes with Python .
The standard linear algebra methods you seem to be thinking of cannot ( to the best of my knowledge ) be used to solve this sort of constrained integer problem .
You will probably find answers to all your questions regarding NumPy and parallel programming on the official wiki .
Also the size will increase as I process data with higher and higher horizontal resolution .
Where each row ( of a fixed arbitrary width ) is shifted by one .
ATLAS 3.10 doesn't know how to handle a lower number of cores than the number it had at build time and generate an exception .
This doesn't result in a ` NaN ` in the last place of your array though .
I've tried to add -march=i486 to the gcc line , as suggested in this post :
I tried indexing it before but i didn't get the trick of adding 1 to the size of label 1 before .
Merging ND array into single array and list
Its not complaning any error , so I don't know what to do in this case .
Here is a sample implementation : #CODE
And then proceed with the split of each shuffled array as in HYRY's answer .
This is quite a generic solution : #CODE
List comprehensions and generator expressions are fairly fast , and they don't suffer any overhead from trying to guess what the type or size of the returned item should be , as they don't care .
Examples and further explanation of this 40-year-old algorithm at the matplotlib FAQ .
The copy will only copy the memory page on which the refcount integer resides .
What is the cleanest way to add a field to a structured numpy array ?
Is there any way to redefine my function so it will pass without warnings ?
@USER : the reference count might be needed ( though I'm not entirely sure in this case ) because no other thread must deallocate the array .
I looked around but couldn't find anything syntax wise regarding this specific scenario .
While this involves copying , do you do this often enough for the cost of the copy to be a problem ?
I think you can see where this is going .
Here is a sample function ( you need to have the pyopencv module installed ): #CODE
I have learned now that numpy does internally create a temporary array for the output and in the end copies this array , that is why it fails for the values that are zero in the original array .
If your list is sorted , you can achieve very quick search of index with the ' bisect ' package .
How to save a boolean matrix ?
I have need to slice an array where I would like zero to be assumed for every dimension except the first .
will compile machine code that will execute fast and with minimal memory overhead , taking care of memory locality stuff ( and thus cache optimization ) if the same array occurs several times in your expression ,
First , note that for most everyday uses , you probably won't require an array ( which is a special datatype in Numpy ) .
Not sure if it helps but if you add another array of a different shape , it converts back to the types you want : #CODE
plus lists of known objects falling inside the field of view .
Look at the documentation here and here to see how to set your backend .
numpy array plot matrix matplotlib
After the records are loaded , I can access them in the normal NumPy fashion .
Eventually , I'm looking for a way of creating graphs similar to the one below using naive Python ( with any " standard " library such as numpy , matplotlib etc , but without using R or other external tools ) .
On a general note however , in numpy it is better to always use base class arrays unless you are doing a lot of matrix multiplications , etc .
Exact , in optimization context , and as far as Powell Badly Scaled function is used for test , I impose some box constraints .
At the moment I have the lines in a list of lists then looping through and testing for identity with the previous value at index 0 in the list but this is very clumsy .
Calculating the exact dimensions of this array : I tried len ( x [ 0 ]) and len ( x ) to get the both dimensional coordinates , but this way seems a bit hackish .
If you know the size , you might want to consider pre-allocating the array and parsing it yourself .
What does the autocorrelation array look like if you plot it ?
Where it says : #CODE
